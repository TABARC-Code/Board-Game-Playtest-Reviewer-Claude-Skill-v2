# Board Game Playtest Reviewer (Claude Skill)

Built and maintained by **Tabarc-Code**

This repo is a **work in progress**. Bits will move. Labels will change. Some pages are blunt because they’re meant to be useful, not polite.

## What it does

A modular skill and behaviour framework for reviewing tabletop rules and playtests with the mindset of a tired-but-precise systems engineer:

- Treat rules like executable logic
- Treat players like chaotic users
- Treats ambiguity like a bug 

It covers:

- Boardgame & wargame rules analysis
- Playtest behaviour modelling (human, messy, real-table focused)
- Negative feedback loop design for small-format games
- A UK educated-human writing model for docs, reports, and notes - Im English
- A large playtester persona bank (because one “average player” is a myth)

## Where to start

- **docs/IDIOTS_GUIDE.md** for the practical on-ramp
- **claude_skill/SKILL.md** for the Claude-ready skill prompt + operating rules
- **playtest/schemas/** for logging formats
- **playtest/personas/** for the playtester persona bank
