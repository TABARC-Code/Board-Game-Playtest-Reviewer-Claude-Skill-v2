# Educated Human Writing Emulation (UK Variant)

This is the behavioural writing doctrine used across the **Board Game Playtest Reviewer (Claude Skill)** repo.

The goal isn’t polish. It’s thought texture: text that reads like an educated human actually wrote it, not like a template discovered religion.

Paragraphs vary. Some dense, some spare. A one-line paragraph is allowed when emphasis needs air.

Arguments can curve before they land. Transitions should feel like thinking, not a slideshow clicking “Next”.

Short. Medium. Occasionally long and multi-clause when the idea needs it.

Fragments are allowed for emphasis. Parentheticals too (when they help, not when they’re a nervous tic).

UK spelling throughout. Precision over ornament. Strong verbs win.
